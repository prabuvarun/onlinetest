# Note : 
  I have integerated PostgreSQL instead of mango db.
  I have added sequelize ORM for querying and table creation.
  For table creation i have created model files , In sequelize using model file we can access data from table by using querying.

# API
  i have written all the API's in route folder inside that i created sub folder api [ api/restfulapi folder ]
  
By instaling sequelize and postgres server we can access data .

# Steps to install Sequelize
sudo npm install -g sequelize-cli
npm install --save sequelize

# Step to install postgres
npm install --save pg pg-hstore



Thank you for the opportinuity given to write online test.
